				<h2> <strong> ABOUT ME </strong> </h2>
					<p> Let me introduce myself, Dimitri BEHIER-CARRIERE, student at the KEDGE BS school. 

					After my Baccalaureate, I didn't really know which studies to turn to, I decided to do accounting like my parents. 

					During these years of study at the IAE of Bordeaux, I did two internships. These two internships allowed me to realize that I did not want to do accounting, but one subject I was strongly interested in, corporate finance. I was interested in the access routes and which schools would be able to best prepare me for these studies. I didn't choose to join KEDGE BS to enter a simple business school, but rather to join the school that offers one of the best Master's degrees specialized in sustainable finance. So I have prepared competitions to get in. I decided to take a year off to do internships in the field of finance and if possible in sustainable finance. These internships will allow me to acquire new skills in the field of finance and to apply what I have learned in my finance courses.

						I also like to visit my grandparents who are close to my home, even if it is complicated as a Covid.  And I also like to see my friends.

						I practice some sports like Rugby from 5 years, Tennis 10 years, Football 5 years. When the winter season is comming, i like to go in the moutain to make some ski.
